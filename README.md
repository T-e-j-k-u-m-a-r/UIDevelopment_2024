# UIDevelopment_2024

Welcome to the `UIDevelopment_2024` project! This repository contains the code and build instructions for developing a simple UI for a customer login page on a banking website. The UI is created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and includes various web elements and user actions to facilitate a realistic and functional user interface.

## Build Steps

### 1. Code Checkout
- **Objective:** Retrieve the latest version of the code from the repository.
- **Command:** 
  ```sh
  git pull origin main
  ```

### 2. Build UI
- **Objective:** Compile and build the UI components using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- **Instructions:** Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed, and then run the build command to compile the project.

### 3. Run Tests
- **Objective:** Execute front-end tests to validate the functionality of web elements and user actions.
- **Instructions:** Use a testing framework (e.g., Cypress, Jasmine, or Mocha) to run automated tests and ensure the UI behaves as expected.

### 4. Deploy
- **Objective:** Deploy the built UI to a staging environment for further testing.
- **Instructions:** Use deployment scripts or a continuous integration tool (e.g., Jenkins) to push the compiled UI to the staging environment.

### 5. Report
- **Objective:** Generate and archive test and build reports for review.
- **Instructions:** Configure the reporting tools to generate HTML or PDF reports and store them in a designated folder for easy access.

## Post-build Actions

### 1. Archive Build Artifacts
- **Objective:** Save the build artifacts, such as compiled files and reports, for future reference or deployment.
- **Instructions:** Store these artifacts in a dedicated directory or a cloud storage solution.

### 2. Send Notifications
- **Objective:** Notify the team of the build status, whether successful or failed.
- **Instructions:** Configure email notifications or integration with messaging platforms (e.g., Slack) to alert team members automatically.
